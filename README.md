<a href="www.thequantizer.com">The Quantizer</a>

Original PYNQ Z1 board files can be found here  
 * https://github.com/cathalmccabe/pynq-z1_board_files/raw/master/pynq-z1.zip

 
 Add the board files into this directory (I had to create the folder `board_files`)
 
 * `Xilinx\Vivado\2021.1\data\boards\board_files`  

Original xdc file for the PYNQ Z1 can be found here
